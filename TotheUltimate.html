<h1>When The Guru Invades</h1>
<p>
    Millions of people's  never analyze themselves .<br/>
     Mentally they're mechanical products of the factory of their invironment <br/>
      preoccupied by breakfast,lunch and dinner <br/>
       working and sleeping and going here and there to be entertained <br/>
        They don't know what and why they are seeking <br/>
        nor why they never realize complete happiness and lasting satisfaction
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    Life is a fabulous phenomenon if you know how to ride it.<br/>
    Sadhana or spiritual practices empower you to ride the surf of Life.

<h1>The Only Place In the Entire Cosmos</h1>
<h2>DHYANLINGA</h2>
<p>You are my Guru's will <br/>
My only obsession<br/>
In my dreams and wakefulness<br/>
My only longing was to fulfill you <br/>
<br/>
Willing to do anything <br/>
That men should and should not <br/>
willing to offer myself and <br/>
Another hundred lives if need be <br/>
<br/>
Here now that you have happened<br/>
O'Glorious one<br/>
May your glory and grace <br/>
Stir the sleeping hordes<br/>
Into wakefulness and light<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have happened<br/>
And the gift of life is still with me <br/>
What shall i do with myself <br/>
<br/>
Have lived the peaks for too long <br/>
Time to graze the valleys of life <br/>
         <br/>
         <br/>
           Sadhguru
