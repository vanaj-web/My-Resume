<h1>Gymnastic (1st love and still with me)</h1>
<p>I have been in gymnastic since i was a kid a high school kid . And this sport has given me a lot <br/>
it brings perseverance,discipline,consistency and a lot more in an individual personality.<br/>
<br/>
A trip to the gym can lead to better heart health, lower blood pressure, stronger<br/>
 more toned muscles, as well as an array of mental benefits. <br/>
 <br/>
 Exercise can shift your perspective from societal beauty standards to <br/>
 appreciating your body's capabilities and feeling confident in your skin.<br/>
 <br/>
 People who exercise regularly have better mental health and emotional wellbeing <br/>
 and lower rates of mental illness. Exercise is important<br/>
  for people with mental illness . <br/>
  it not only boosts our mood,<br/> 
 concentration and alertness, but improves our cardiovascular and overall physical health.<br/>
 <br/>
 A physical stature on a man when he walks into a room it gives him an advantage in business,in life,<br/>
 and in everywhere you go, you got to carry that with you.<br/>
 <br/>
 when you get out of the Gym after <br/>
 completing ur workout for that day and when u take off ur t-shirt and watch urself in the mirror<br/>
 with that naked body , thats the best feeling in the world literally Nothing can replace That.<br/>
 it feels as if a i am at the Top of the world<br/>
